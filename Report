# Lab 2 - Soldering and Reverse Engineering

## By: Olivia Lohre
# Summary
The goal of this lab was to learn the techniques associated with soldering circuit components as well as how to build a robot model based on a set of instructions and a finished replica. The idea behind reverse engineering is that by examining and taking apart a product, this helps better understand how the parts are put together in order to make the whole. 

Lab goal; summary of work performed; summary of outcome
Lab 1 will be somewhat different since this is an introduction to the equipment.
# Materials
List materials used in the lab (not the testing equipment, but that used to build the lab project)
# Assembly Procedures
Provide basic summary of steps performed in lab (Do not copy and paste from lab assignment.) The important part here is to provide detail that you had to develop in the lab which will be more important in later labs.
You must include Schematics, Engineering Drawings, and Programming if appropriate in this section.
1. This is step 1.
2. This is step 2.
3. This is step 3.
I am now including an image as an example:

# Test Equipment
List multimeters and other equipment used for testing and creating results.
# Test Procedures
How did you test the system to get your results
# Test Results
What are your results?
# Discussion
Did you make any design decisions that had an impact on the results? How did they impact the results? What do the results mean?
